# Decisions

A dated, append-only narrative of choices made during planning and execution
-- not a source of current counts or facts. If a sentence here would state a
number or a status that a command could compute, prefer the command; a
narrative entry is a record of *why*, not a live dashboard. (See
CLAUDE.md's note on the same rule.)

Entries are appended by `/n8-exec`, `/n8-replan`, and any session that makes
a decision outside those commands (a project's `CLAUDE.md` should carry the
standing instruction to log here; `/n8-init` writes it).

Format:

```markdown
## /n8-exec M1 -- 2026-08-27

- **Decision:** <what was chosen>
  **Why:** <the reasoning>
  **Issue:** <#N>
```

Ad-hoc entries (decisions made outside a planning/execution command) use:

```markdown
## Ad-hoc -- 2026-08-27

- **Change:** <what changed>
  **Why:** <the reasoning>
  **Affects:** <milestones/issues likely affected>
```

## /n8-init — 2026-09-27

- **Decision:** Package id `com.honestarcade.chess`, label "Honest Chess", Dart package `honest_chess`, slug `honestchess` (keystore files and Cloud project `honestchess-ci`), minSdk 24, portrait only, Android only.
  **Why:** The studio's naming, as for Solitaire and Sudoku; one slug for both keys because the template's `rename_app.py` uses one.
  **Issue:** #1
- **Decision:** Template applied from `honestarcade/android-studio-app-template` `origin/main` by `git archive`, not by clone, so the new repository starts with its own history.
  **Why:** The template's history is not this app's.
  **Issue:** #1

## /n8-roadmap — 2026-09-27

- **Decision:** Rules scope is FIDE Laws of Chess 2023, Basic Rules (Arts. 1–5) plus 6.9 and 9; threefold repetition and the fifty-move rule end the game automatically; dead-position detection is limited to insufficient material; arbiter procedure is out.
  **Why:** Owner's answer to the totalising "full rule set" question; the design's prototype had no repetition rule at all.
  **Issue:** #3, milestone M2
- **Decision:** The computer is our own pure-Dart engine in an isolate, not Stockfish.
  **Why:** Owner's choice: no dependencies, no native code, no GPL obligation; Master targets roughly 1800–2000.
  **Issue:** #4
- **Decision:** Move list, captured-piece tray, puzzles and landscape tablet layout are post-v1.
  **Why:** Owner selected none of the design's "next" items for v1.
  **Issue:** #12
- **Decision:** Milestones follow Honest Solitaire's shape (M0 infrastructure, M1 CI, M2 engine, M3 board, M4 screens/persistence, M5 brand/accessibility, M6 testing, M7 launch, M8 audit), with the engine and computer as two epics in one milestone.
  **Why:** The shape carried two apps to a release; the computer is chess's counterpart of Solitaire's solver.
  **Issue:** #1–#11
- **Decision:** The Audit milestone has no epic of its own; findings attach to the epic they concern.
  **Why:** The n8SDLC convention (Solitaire had an audit epic; this app does not).
  **Issue:** M8
